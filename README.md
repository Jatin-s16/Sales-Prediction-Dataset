## Project Overview
This project analyzes advertising expenditure data (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and its impact on product sales using linear regression.

## Key Findings
1. **TV advertising** has the highest impact on sales (correlation: 0.78)
2. The linear regression model achieves **R² = 0.90**, indicating strong predictive power
3. Removing TV advertising from the model significantly reduces performance (R² drops to -0.05)
